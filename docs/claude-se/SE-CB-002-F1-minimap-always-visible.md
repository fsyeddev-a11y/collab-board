<!-- CLAUDE-SE CHANGE LOG — Auto-generated by Claude-SE after implementing a spec. -->

**Spec Implemented**: CB-002 F1 — Minimap Always Visible
**Date**: 2026-02-22

**Summary of Changes**: Ensured the tldraw minimap is expanded (not collapsed) by default when a board loads. The tldraw `DefaultNavigationPanel` uses `useLocalStorageState('minimap', true)` which defaults to collapsed. Added a module-level localStorage pre-seed that sets the key to `false` (expanded) on first visit, while respecting any existing user preference.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/BoardPage.tsx` — Added module-level localStorage pre-seed (lines 31-37) to default minimap to expanded state

**Files Created**:
- `docs/claude-se/SE-CB-002-F1-minimap-always-visible.md` — This change log

**Tests Added/Modified**:
- None — no new tests needed. The change is a one-line localStorage pre-seed at module level. All 79 existing tests pass. TypeScript type-check passes.

**How to Verify**:
1. Clear localStorage for the app domain (DevTools → Application → Local Storage → clear the `minimap` key if present)
2. Open any board in the browser
3. Confirm the minimap is visible and expanded in the bottom-left corner (showing the bird's-eye canvas view, not just zoom controls)
4. Confirm zoom controls (+, -, zoom menu, reset/fit) are visible alongside the minimap
5. Confirm clicking on the minimap pans the viewport to that area
6. Confirm the toggle button (chevron icon) can collapse/expand the minimap, and the preference persists on reload
7. Confirm the custom toolbar and context menu still work as before

**Flagged Issues**: None
